i am arya-man.

appreciate you for being here.

whether it’s dissecting massive SaaS architectures or tinkering with hardware, i love diving deep into the nitty-gritty. 

sharing what i’ve learned is like a virtual high-five, and i’m constantly on the lookout for new challenges. 

next up on my radar? game dev and sharpening my cpp skills

always happy to talk on [twitter](https://twitter.com/aryamantwts) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryamangupta1).
