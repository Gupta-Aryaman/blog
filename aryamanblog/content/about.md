i am arya-man.

appreciate you for being here.

whether i'm dissecting **massive SaaS architectures** or **tinkering with hardware**, i thrive on diving deep into the details. sharing what i learn feels super empowering, and it’s all fueled by my constant hunt for **new challenges**.

this little corner of the internet has been my secret spot for **ideas, projects, and favorite reads** — until now. i’m really excited to have you along for the ride!

next up on my radar? **game dev** and sharpening my cpp skills

always happy to talk on [*twitter*](https://twitter.com/aryamantwts) and [*linkedin*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryamangupta1).
